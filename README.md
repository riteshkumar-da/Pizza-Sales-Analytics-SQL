# Pizza-Sales-Analytics-SQL

## 📌 Description / Purpose
Many businesses collect large volumes of sales data but struggle to convert it into meaningful insights such as understanding customer buying behavior, identifying best-selling products, tracking revenue performance, and making data-driven decisions.

This project solves these challenges by performing end-to-end SQL-based analysis on pizza sales data. Using structured SQL queries, I analyzed orders, revenue trends, customer preferences, and product performance to generate actionable business insights.
